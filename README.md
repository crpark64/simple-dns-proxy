Custom DNS Server (IPv4 only)

This is a Custom DNS server. (IPv4 only, Standalone)

Personally created it for testing mobile phone apps.

I wanted to make it possible for the app to connect to a specific IP address on my mobile phone.

By using this custom DNS server, I was able to connect a specific domain to a specific IP (my personal web server in my case).

If there is no DNS information, you will receive an address from Google's DNS. You can also get it from another DNS server.
(The default when there is no address is the Google DNS server.)

Tested it with Python 3.7.3 (Windows, AMD64).


1. Add the domain and address you want to the source. (dns3.py)

2. Of the "CustomDNSResolver" class Modify the variable "customDomainDictionary".
<pre>
  ex)
      'mydomain.co.kr': &lt;YOUR_IPv4_ADDRESS&gt;,
      'mydomain.co.kr': '192.168.0.201',
      'yourdomain.co.kr': '192.168.0.205',
</pre>

3. Start the Custom-IPv4-DNS server.
<pre>
  usage: 
      python.exe dns3.py
</pre>
  
4. Test at Windows Command Prompt
<pre>
  c:\&gt; nslookup mydomain.co.kr 127.0.0.1
    Server:    UnKnown
    Address:  127.0.0.1

    Name:    mydomain.co.kr
    Addresses:  192.168.0.201
              192.168.0.201
</pre>



If you can not start the DNS server, please execute the following command.
<pre>
    pip install certifi
    pip install chardet
    pip install dnslib
    pip install idna
    pip install requests
    pip install urllib3
</pre>

Enjoy!
